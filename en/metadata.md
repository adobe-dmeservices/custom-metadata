#### **Metadata**
Universally, metadata is described a set of data that gives information about other data. Adobe created a metadata specification called [XMP](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html) that many applications (Adobe and otherwise) support. Adobe Bridge and the FileInfo Panel (found in most Adobe desktop applications) allow users to view and edit metadata in pre-defined forms, but they does not provide a method to easily customize these forms for new metadata schemas. The **Custom Metadata Panel** extension allows a user to customize these fields to provide thorough descriptions of an asset.
