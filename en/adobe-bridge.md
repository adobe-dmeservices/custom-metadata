#### **Adobe Bridge**
Adobe Bridge part of Adobe's [Creative Cloud](https://creativecloud.adobe.com). It is a powerful asset management tool for Creatives and Enterprises that lets users preview, select, organize, edit and publish multiple Creative assets quickly and easily. In Adobe Bridge, users can easily edit the metadata of one or more assets to improve the search experience for end-users, empower Enterprise workflows, and more clearly inform upstream processes that depend on metadata.

The panel also works in Photoshop and Illustrator, but the panel will display metadata for the document that is in focus.

The purpose of this guide is to provide an overview of how to customize metadata forms using the Custom Metadata Panel.
