# Custom Metadata Panel
### Focus your attention on critical metadata in this configurable form. Mix and match standard and custom metadata fields to show the properties critical to your business.

The Custom Metadata Panel provides Enterprises and individuals with a way to focus their attention on critical metadata in one panel.

The panel is completely customizable and helps end users and DAM managers tune their metadata view for maximum accuracy and efficiency. With many form field types and available metadata presets, it expands the metadata capabilities of Creative Cloud Desktop applications without using XML or special coding.
Form fields include:
* Text and Multiple Text
* Language Alternatives for Text Fields
* Numbers and Multiple Numbers
* Tags (like Keywords)
* Dropdown
* Multi-select Dropdown
* Date and Multi-Date
* Checkbox and Checkbox Group
* Switch and Switch Group
* Radio Buttons
* URL and Multiple URL fields that link to external web sites
* Complex structures
* Tables
* Calculation Fields
* Hidden fields
* AEM Tags (special case just for Adobe Experience Manager)

Other features include a read-only entries, synced field values, section dividers, a built-in form editor, form definition file import and export, metadata Preset import and export, and the ability to use a URL as the location for the form. This last feature is ideal for Enterprise or group applications, where a DAM Manager posts the form to a common location and all users get the latest and greatest. For full docuentation, please see our [user guide](https://github.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata/wiki).

See the Table of Contents for help with using and configuring the panel.

## Changes for 2.0.12
This release improved linked item support for Custom Metadata in InDesign. InDesign documents often include linked Library items, Cloud Documents, and even AEM Assets. While Custom Metadata can directly inspect metadata from traditionally linked assets, Cloud objects don't have the same properties available. To make it easier to inspect metadata for these items, we have introduced round trip workflows.

### Linked Library Items
When you select a linked Library item, its original application may be available to view and edit metadata. If so, Custom metadata will display the option to view metadata in the originating application.

### Linked Cloud Documents
InDesign supports placing Photoshop and InDesign Cloud documents. Custom Metadata will now allow you to open linked Photoshop Cloud Documents directly from Custom Metadata. You will need to open linked Cloud InDesign documents from the Home screen.

### Linked AEM Assets
When a local copy of a linked AEM Asset is not available to InDesign, Custom Metadata will now present a button to open the asset's Properties page in AEM. You can then view both XMP and AEM metadata. If you check out the linked asset from Asset Link in InDesign, then Custom Metadata will have a local copy and can display the asset's XMP metadata directly.

## Changes for 2.0.11
### UI text resize and Asset Link support for InDesign
Users can now resize the text in Custom Metadata Panel screens. This control is available from the flyout menu and also from the context menu (right-click). Preferences are also available from the context menu. ***NOTE: You must enable System Contextual Menus in Settings to see the menu***

Users can also view and edit XMP metadata for checked out linked AEM Assets when using AEM Asset Link. Check out is required to access XMP, because check out downloads the full binary to your computer. When you are done editing metadata, you can check the asset back in to send the changes back to AEM.

![InDesign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata/refs/heads/master/Images_CEP_%20Adobe%20Bridge%20User%20Guide/resizeview.gif)

## Changes for 2.0.9 & 2.0.10
### Improved InDesign support
This clarifies whether a linked asset's XMP metadata can be viewed or edited. Since InDesign does not provide a way to read or write the full XMP packet to and from Library items and linked Cloud Documents, we now tell you that in the UI. We also don't yet support editing metadata for linked AEM Asset Link assets, but we are working on that and should have a solution shortly.

![InDesign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata/refs/heads/master/Images_CEP_%20Adobe%20Bridge%20User%20Guide/InDesign.gif)

## Changes for 2.0.8
### InDesign support
This release brings Custom Metadata to InDesign. You can view and edit XMP metadata for the active InDesign document and also any linked assets that support XMP. InDesign Cloud Documents and multiple selections are also supported.

This release also fixes some irregularities with multiple selections that may have resulted in unexpected values being written to the form when choosing "Merge Values." It also allows merging of Text fields that are Language Alternatives with no defined alternative languages, such as Description in Dublin Core.
![InDesign](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adobe-dmeservices/custom-metadata/refs/heads/master/Images_CEP_%20Adobe%20Bridge%20User%20Guide/InDesign.gif)

## Changes for 2.0.7
### Preset import and export
This release adds the ability to import and export Metadata Presets from the Settings menu. When an imported preset already exists (by name), the user can choose to replace or merge the presets. When merging, the new preset values replace the existing values, but any existing values not in the new preset will remain.

We also added documentation links in the Flyout menu for XMP, IPTC Photo & Video, PLUS, AVM

It also improves error handling and makes messages more informative and consistent.

## Changes for 2.0.6
### Introduces the Calculation Field
[Watch a video for the 2.0.5 and 2.0.6 features](https://youtu.be/r3iqeYmCtTM)

Calc fields allow you to combine values from other fields in your view. The field will be read only for the user, but it will change based on the values of the referenced fields. The result can be either a string or a number, and the result will be stored in the XMP.

When calculating a number, it is a best practice to refer to Number fields, however if you need to use special values such as π or e, users can enter those directly.

Enter your calculated value as text. You can reference other fields in your view by using the field's XMP prefix and property name in curly braces, separated by `:`. For example, if you have a field with the XMP property name `myField`with the prefix `myPrefix` and you want to add it to another field, you would enter `{myPrefix:myField}` in the calculation field to use it in a calculation.

For example, assume you have a form that tracks pets with a custom namespace of prefix `pet`. If the user enters "dog" for the type of pet, and "dachsund" for the breed, then a calculated field with calculated value of "The {pet:petType} is a {pet:breed}." will be stored in XMP as "The dog is a dachsund."

When calculating a number, it is a best practice to refer to Number fields in your calculated value. Operations include +, -, *, /, ^, !, ln, log, and root. You can use parentheses to ensure calculation precedence. You can use the following trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh. Constants include e, π or pi. You can use the Combination (C) and Permutation (P) operators, such as 2P2 => 12 and 4C2 => 6. You can also use Sigma or ∑ to calculate sums. for example Sigma(1,100,n) results 5050

Users can use the constants π, pi, or e in calculations. Imaginary numbers are not supported.

We also added a button on the Settings page to reset Custom Metadata to its default state. This will not remove presets, but it will remove any Tabs. The prior Settings file will be backed up in the Settings folder, which now can be revealed via the flyout menu. Additionally, Custom Metadata will warn you if you open the Settings panel when you have unsaved changes.

This release also updates the AVM preset to version 1.1, which includes Tags for `Subject:Category`. It also updates the PLUS preset to include URL fields and to align shared fields with IPTC.

This release also fixes the following bugs:
- Tags do not render correctly in some circumstances
- Presets may not apply to assets properly in some circumstances

## Changes for Version 2.0.5
### Introduces the Table Field and a new editing paradigm for Field Options
This release introduces a new Field: Tables. Tables display correlated properties in a tabular format, with each column representing a property and each row representing a correlated value across all properties. 

- Columns can be Text, Number or Dropdown Fields.
- Rows can be reordered by the user
- Tables can have row legends, for cases where the order of the items in each property corresponds to a specific kind of value. For instance, if item[0] represents the X coordinate of a position and item[1] represents the Y coordinate of a position, then you can have a legend for row 1 "X Coordinate" and a legend for row 2 "Y Coordinate"
- You can limit the minimum and maximum number of rows in a Table's value
- You can use Tables in Presets

We also redesigned the Options editor to remove the JSON Field and replace it with a table-based form for easier editing.

We also added IPTC and PLUS tabs to the first launch experience, and added a button to create new Tabs from the example Views. We also introduced a preset for the Astronomy Visualization Metadata Standard (AVM). We believe these will make it easier for users to get started with Custom Metadata.

## Changes for Version 2.0.4
This fixes an issue where options were not filtering properly. 

We also added the following new features:
- You can now automatically set a field value on a filtered field when the options reduce to one value
- Text fields will now automatically become multi-text when the existing value is an array

## Changes for Version 2.0.3
Bug fixes.

## Changes for Version 2.0.2
This release addresses multiple user-reported issues and adds much-requested features. We are updating the public documentation and refreshing videos, but we have updated the in-app help text. Additionally, the What's New screen contains some helpful copy and short videos. While not comprehensive, here's a list of additions, improvements, and bug fixes.
