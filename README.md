# Custom Metadata Panel for Bridge
## Focus your attention on critical metadata in this configurable form. Mix and match standard and custom metadata fields to show the properties critical to your business.

The Custom Metadata Panel for Bridge provides Enterprises and individuals with a way to focus their attention on critical metadata in one panel.

The panel is completely customizable and helps end users and DAM managers tune their metadata view for maximum accuracy and efficiency. With 7 form field types and metadata presets, it expands the metadata capabilities of Bridge without using XML or special coding.
Form fields include:
* Text
* Multiple Text
* Tags (like Keywords)
* Dropdown
* Multi-select Dropdown
* Date Picker
* AEM Tags (special case just for Adobe Experience Manager)

Other features include a read-only entries, section dividers, a built-in form editor, form definition file import and export, and the ability to use a URL as the location for the form. This last feature is ideal for Enterprise or group applications, where a DAM Manager posts the form to a common location and all users get the latest and greatest.
